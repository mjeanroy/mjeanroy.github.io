## Consistent Hashing in Java

In computer science, consistent hashing is an hashing technique used to re-balance the minimum entires in the current set.
It is especially used in distributed systems, for exemple when you want to implement a distributed cache in memory.

But, first, let's see what problems it solved.

### ➡️ Naive Hasing

Suppose that you want to implement a distributed cache accross `n` servers, something like that:

In this case, when you want to check that a given key is stored in the cache, you have two solutions:

- Check each servers, and stop as soon as one of them returns a positive answer.
- Use an hash function to map a key to a server and check one, and only one server!

Note that the `hash` function can be implemented using any algorithm (MD5, SHA-1, FNV1, etc.), it does not really matter: as long as it can be converted, it's easy to choose a server using a very simple modulo.

For example, suppose the key `"Hello World"`, and suppose we have those 4 servers:

<img src="/static/blog/consistent-hashing/02.svg" width="400" style="margin: 0"/>

The main advantage of this technique is that it is really easy to implement, for example, here is a very basic implementation in Java:

```java
public interface HashFunction {
  int compute(String value);
}
```

```java
public final class Node {
  private final String id;

  public Node(String id) {
    this.id = id;
  }

  public String getId() {
    return id;
  }
}
```

```java
public final class Cluster {
  private final List<Node> nodes;
  private final HashFunction hashFunction;

  public Cluster(List<Node> nodes, HashFunction hashFunction) {
    this.nodes = new ArrayList<>(nodes);
    this.hashFunction = hashFunction;
  }

  public Node findNode(String value) {
    if (nodes.isEmpty()) {
      throw new IllegalStateException("Cannot find node in an empty cluster");
    }

    int hash = Math.abs(hashFunction.compute(value));
    return nodes.get(hash % nodes.size());
  }
}
```

And that's it!

BUT: the main problem with this solution is when you need to add/remove node: when this happens, you have to re-map (or invalidate) almost all the keys!

The solution to this problem is: **consistent hashing**

### ➡️ Consistent Hashing

Consistent Hashing is a technique that sees the cluster as a "ring" in which each node is positioned.
For example:

<img src="/static/blog/consistent-hashing/03.svg" width="400" style="margin: 0"/>

Here, we have four node: `srv1`, `srv2`, `srv3` and `srv4`.

Now, suppose that we want to map a key to a given node: for that, we use the same hashing function and we put the resulting key on the ring: the next server (clockwise) on the ring will be the winner!

Let's see an example:

<img src="/static/blog/consistent-hashing/04.svg" width="400" style="margin: 0"/>

- We still have our four nodes: `srv1`, `srv2`, `srv3` and `srv4`
- We can now map `k1`, `k2` and `k3` 🚀

The main advantage of this technique is that adding or removing a node in the cluster only needs to re-map few keys:

<img src="/static/blog/consistent-hashing/05.svg" width="400" style="margin: 0"/>

In the example below, we suppose that `srv4` goes down: all we have to do is to re-map keys located between `srv3` and `srv4` to `srv1` 🎉

Let's see how to implement this in Java:

```java
public interface HashFunction {
  int compute(String value);
}
```

```java
public final class Node {
  private final String id;

  public Node(String id) {
    this.id = id;
  }

  public String getId() {
    return id;
  }
}
```

```java
public final class Cluster {
  private final SortedMap<Integer, Node> nodes;
  private final HashFunction hashFunction;

  public Cluster(List<Node> nodes, HashFunction hashFunction) {
    this.nodes = new TreeMap<>();
    this.hashFunction = hashFunction;

    for (Node node : nodes) {
      this.nodes.put(computeHash(node), node);
    }
  }

  public Node findNode(String value) {
    if (nodes.isEmpty()) {
      throw new IllegalStateException("Cannot find node in an empty cluster");
    }

    int hash = computeHash(value);
    if (nodes.containsKey(hash)) {
      return nodes.get(hash);
    }

    // Get next node on the ring.
    SortedMap<Integer, RingNode> tailMap = nodes.tailMap(hash);
    if (tailMap.isEmpty()) {
      // If we don't have a "next" node, get the first one.
      tailMap = nodes;
    }

    return tailMap.get(tailMap.firstKey());
  }

  private int computeHash(String value) {
    return Math.abs(hashFunction.compute(value));
  }
}
```

Let's see how it works:

👉 Our ring is implemented using a `TreeMap`, this allows us to:
  - Add node in the ring in `O(log n)`
  - Remove node in the ring in `O(log n)`
  - Find node in the ring in `O(log n)`

👉 An alternative would be to implement the ring using a sorted list, in this case:
  - Adding can be implemented in `O(n)`
  - Removing a node can be implemented in `O(n)`
  - Finding node can be implemented in `O(log n)` (using a simple binary lookup).

Even if I did not implement node addition / removal in this example, I chose to use a `TreeMap` because it seems more efficient :)

### ➡️ Going Further

Consistent Hashing is a really great technique to have in your "besace" if you work on a distributed system.

The implementation above is very simple, if you want to go further, I suggest you to:

- Implement node addition / removal
- Implement virtual nodes*

_Virtual nodes is a technique where we can add, for any node in the ring, additional "virtual" nodes (node that does not really exists, but "points" to the real node), the idea being to adjust & balance key mapping across the ring_

Or, if you want to take a look, checkout my [GitHub project](https://github.com/mjeanroy/consistent-hashing-4j) where I implemented all of this and let me know what you think :)
